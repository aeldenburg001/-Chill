# &Chill

<strong>&Chill</strong> is the next generation of app, for the next generation of working professionals.

We found that after a long day at work the worst thing we had to do was make another decision.

What are the two things most working professionals have to decide at 6pm when they get off work? What to eat and what to watch!

Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing to save that two or three hours you spend trying to make those decisions, and just chill?

&Chill will provide its users movie recommendations based on their mood. Users can also find food recommendations based on their location, previous user reviews, and by cuisine type.
